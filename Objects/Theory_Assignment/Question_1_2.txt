Ans : Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities, while arrays are used to store ordered collections of data. Objects are defined using curly braces `{}` and consist of key-value pairs, whereas arrays are defined using square brackets `[]` and consist of indexed elements.


Question 2: Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
Ans : In JavaScript, you can access and update object properties using either dot notation or bracket notation.
Dot notation is used when you know the exact name of the property, while bracket notation is useful when the property name is dynamic or not a valid identifier.
Dot Notation:

let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};
console.log(person.name); // Accessing property using dot notation
person.age = 31; // Updating property using dot notation
console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
```
Bracket Notation:

let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};
console.log(person['name']); // Accessing property using bracket notation
person['age'] = 31; // Updating property using bracket notation
