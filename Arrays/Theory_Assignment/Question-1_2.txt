Question 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array?
// Answer:
// An array in JavaScript is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. It is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.
// To declare and initialize an array, you can use the following syntax:
let myArray = []; // Declaring an empty array
let myArray = [1, 2, 3]; // Declaring and initializing an array with values
// You can also use the Array constructor:
let myArray = new Array(1, 2, 3); // Declaring and initializing an array with values
// You can also create an array with a specific length:
let myArray = new Array(5); // Declaring an array with a length of 5, which will contain undefined values by default.



Question 2: Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays.
// Answer:
// The methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() are used to manipulate arrays in JavaScript:   
// 1. push(): This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4); // myArray is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
// 2. pop(): This method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. It changes the length of the array.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
myArray.pop(); // myArray is now [1, 2, 3], and the returned value is 4
// 3. shift(): This method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It also changes the length of the array.
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.shift(); // myArray is now [2, 3], and the returned value is 1
// 4. unshift(): This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
let myArray = [2, 3]; 
myArray.unshift(1); // myArray is now [1, 2, 3], and the returned value is 3
// These methods are commonly used for adding or removing elements from arrays, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the array's contents.
