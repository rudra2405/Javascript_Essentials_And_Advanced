Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?
// Answer: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text. JavaScript interacts with the DOM by providing methods and properties that allow developers to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web pages dynamically. This includes adding, removing, or modifying elements, changing styles, and responding to user events.


Question 2: Explain the methods getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(),and
getElementsByTagName() used to select elements from DOM.
// Answer:
// - getElementById(): This method returns a single element with the specified ID. It is used to select an element uniquely identified by its ID attribute. For example, `document.getElementById('myElement')` returns the element with ID 'myElement'.
// - getElementsByClassName(): This method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the specified class name. It can select multiple elements that share the same class. For example, `document.getElementsByClassName('myClass')` returns all elements with the class 'myClass'.
// - getElementsByTagName(): This method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the specified tag name. It can be used to select all elements of a certain type, such as 'div', 'p', or 'span'. For example, `document.getElementsByTagName('div')` returns all `<div>` elements in the document.
