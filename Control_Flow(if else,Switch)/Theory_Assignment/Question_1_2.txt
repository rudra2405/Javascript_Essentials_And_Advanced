Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work withan example.

Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a script. It allows developers to dictate the path that the program takes based on certain conditions.

If-else statements are a fundamental control flow structure that allows the program to execute different blocks of  code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The basic syntax of an if-else statement is as follows:
```javascript     
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}




Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a
switch statement instead of an if-else statement?

Switch statements in JavaScript provide a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. It is particularly useful when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable. The basic syntax of a switch statement is as follows:
```javascript   
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to execute if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to execute if expression equals value2
        break;
    // more cases as needed
    default:
        // code to execute if no cases match
}
