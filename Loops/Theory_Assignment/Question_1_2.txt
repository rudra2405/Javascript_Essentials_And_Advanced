Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic example of each.

//// In JavaScript, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. There are three primary types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
//// 1. **For Loop**: The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
// ```javascript
// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
//     console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
// }

// 2. **While Loop**: The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
// ```javascript    
// let i = 0;
// while (i < 5) {
//     console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
//     i++;
// }

// 3. **Do-While Loop**: The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
// ```javascript  
// let i = 10;
// do {

//     console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
//     i++; 
// } while (i < 5);



Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

//// The primary difference between a `while` loop and a `do-while` loop is when the condition is checked:
//// - In a **while loop**, the condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop's body. If the condition is false initially, the loop's body will not execute at all.
//// - In a **do-while loop**, the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This means that the loop's body will always execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false initially.
